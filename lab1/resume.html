                            A product development and design firm focused on Web and Mobile consumer products.

                                    Developed a web app that serves as a project manager, implementing views for various controllers we generated, 
                                    creating different models with multiple relations on the database. Testing with Rspec. Developed alongside two interns. 
                                    Which helped the project managers at the firm be a lot more efficient.

                                    Created a jQuery plugin that allows easier implementation of form filling, 
                                    using the Google Maps Api and the Sepomex Api, by automatically filling the remaining address fields. 
                                    Which made other projects 2x faster.
